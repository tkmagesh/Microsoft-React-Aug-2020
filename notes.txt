React
    Component based UI
        
        Component = State + Presentation + UI Behavior
        Application = composition of components

        
        Mail data
        Presentation
        User Interaction Behavior

HTML
    - Independent Open tag is allowed
    - 'for' attribute is allowed
    - 'class' attribute is allowed

JSX 
    - Every open tag must have a close tag
    - use 'htmlFor' as the equivalent for 'for'
    - use 'className' as the equivalent for 'class'
