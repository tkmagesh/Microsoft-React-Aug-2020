React
    Component based UI
        
        Component = State + Presentation + UI Behavior
        Application = composition of components

        
        Mail data
        Presentation
        User Interaction Behavior

HTML
    - Independent Open tag is allowed
    - 'for' attribute is allowed
    - 'class' attribute is allowed

JSX 
    - Every open tag must have a close tag
    - use 'htmlFor' as the equivalent for 'for'
    - use 'className' as the equivalent for 'class'

component lifecycle events

Category
    Mounting
    Updating
    Unmounting

Mounting Category
    componentWillmount
    componentDidMount

Updating Category
    shouldComponentUpdate
    componentWillupdate
    render

Unmounting Category
    componentWillunmount


class MyComponent extends React.Component{
    render(){

    }
}

Hooks
    - functions that allow functional components have all the characteristics of a 'class' component
    - the hook function names MUST start with 'use'
        useState (state management for primitive types (number, string, boolean))
        useEffect
        useMemo
        useReducer (state management for non primitive types (object, array))


Application Setup

JavaScript
    JSX -> JS
    ES6 -> ES5
    bundle the JS files

    Production Build
        minify the JS 
        uglify the JS
        bundle the JS
        version the JS

CSS
    SCSS -> CSS
    bundle the CSS

    Production Build
        minify the CSS
        bundle the CSS
        version the CSS

HTML
    the refereces to JS and CSS to be updated
    minify the HTML

Webserver

Grunt
Gulp
Webpack

CLI - create-react-app

nodejs (LTS)
    npm (NuGet, pip, Gem, maven)
    yarn
        to install yarn
            [sudo] npm install yarn -g

npx

node.js command prompt

yarn --verion

npx create-react-app first-app

CommonJS
AMD - Asynchronous Module Definition

ES6 Modules
    Everything defined in a JS file is considered private
    explicity export of entities
    explicity import entities to use 

Localizing the state for that particular component

State

    UI State
        Data supporting the UI responsibilities
        The probability of this data needed in other components are very low
        Suitable to be maintained in the respective component
            using setState / useState

    App State
        Data supporting the core application logic
        The probability of this data needed through out the application are high
        NOT suitable to be maintained in the component
